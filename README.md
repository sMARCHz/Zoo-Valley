# Zoo-Valley

This is part of front-end of my project. I develop this mobile application to make zoo trip funnier and interesting with AI
There are 3 main features of my application

# 1). ZooBot 
This is chatbot for answer and fix the visitor's questions or problems. It help zoo to accommodate many visitor's questions with AI.
   
# 2). ZooCamera
This is special camera. When you take pictures of animals using this feature, it can predict the animal that you take and give some information about that animal to you by AI.

# 3). ZooAlbum
This is album. It stores all pictures which you take by using ZooCamera. You can use it to see information about that animal in the pictures again.
